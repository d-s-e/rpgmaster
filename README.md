# RPG-Master

RPG-Master is a django based web application for roleplaying gamemasters,
to aid them in leading gaming sessions and building up some ambience and
immersion.

It is designed to run locally without any online access and focused
primarily on classic pen and paper sessions, not those new fancy virtual
desktop thingies.

The TODO.md file contains some ideas of what could be possible.
